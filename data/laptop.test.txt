When my Dell laptop gave up only after 2 1/2 years , I decided to buy MacBook Pro .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Nothing wrong with this computer at all !***O O O O O O O O
And the fact that Apple is driving the 13 RMBP with the Intel4000 graphic chip seems underpowered to me .***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
I have to wonder why Amazon is even selling this dinosaur .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
Apple removed the DVD drive Firewire port will work with adapter and put the SDXC slot in a silly position on the back .***O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O T-NEU O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O

So , I thought why not give Mac Book pro a try .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Set up was a breeze .***T-POS T-POS O O O O
But I do NOT like Win8 .***O O O O O T-NEG O
I have owned at least 4 to 5 laptops and computers , but this is by far the most superior machine I have ever owned .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I am still in the process of learning about its features .***O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O
BTW , I checked online regarding the old laptop that died and found that I was not alone , far from it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I had the same reasons as most PC users , the price , the overbearing restrictions of OSX and lack of support for games .***O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O T-NEG O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O
I wanted it for it 's mobility and man , this little bad boy is very nice .***O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
Seems to me that 's the best way to get Apple 's attention .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Very nice so far .***O O O O O
You wo n't be disappointed .***O O O O O O
The investment of a new MacBook Pro came at a price , but totally worth it for a good piece of mind .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I found the mini to be , Exceptionally easy to set up***O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS
Having USB3 is why I bought this Mini .***O T-POS O O O O O O O
Be sure to have good air flow where ever you put it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O

HUGE Apple MAC Fan !***O O O O O

The settings are not user - friendly either .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O
Honestly , I am surprised no one else has mentioned returning theirs .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Most of them were either too big , too noisy and too slow after 2 years .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The machine is used , but is like new , i ' m very impress .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thank goodness for OpenOffice !***O O O T-POS O
Awesome form factor , great battery life , wonderful UX .***O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS O

Its perfect , not much heavy .***O O O O O O O
i love the keyboard and the screen .***O O O T-POS O O T-POS O
I find it not to be very user friendly .***O O O O O O O O O O
It has surpassed all expectations and fulfilled all my needs .***O O O O O O O O O O O
However , there are MAJOR issues with the touchpad which render the device nearly useless .***O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O
What angers me more than anything else is that I spent all those years hating MACs when I could have been getting a lot more production with a whole lot less grief !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I ' ve already upgraded o Mavericks and I am impressed with everything about this computer .***O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O

I bought this MacBook Pro to replace my six - year - old PC a Sony Vaio , but it was basically no better than my old PC , so I returned it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I wanted a simple , reliable laptop .***O O O O O O O O
Cheaper than buying it @ apple too !***O O O O O O O O

Besides , the apple stocks have been falling due to lack of sales .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Turns out this is a common problem .***O O O O O O O O
Starts up in a hurry and everything is ready to go .***T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
It is also fast as can be you get what you pay for well worth the investment .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But I ' m still learning so ca n't rate it yet for everything .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I was also informed that the components of the Mac Book were dirty .***O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O
So glad I did not waste money on a less than par product .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Have n't regretted it one bit .***O O O O O O O

I think that they are the best out on the market .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
HOWEVER I chose two day shipping and it took over a week to arrive .***O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
That 's quite a bump up from the $ 599 that this little guy sells for , which leaves me to my next point .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is quite smooth as well as heavy and can easily slip through the hands .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Finally decided to try a MAC because there were too many choices of which PC 's to buy and EVERYONE who had a MAC said buy a MAC .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Can you buy any laptop that matches the quality of a MacBook ?***O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O

It is very easy to navigate even for a novice .***O O O O O T-POS O O O O O

I was considering buying the Air , but in reality , this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient , even though it 's about 20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24 " LCD screen , so built in screen size is not terribly important .***O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O
Hopefully my replacement is brand new .***O O O O O O O

I saw the bad reviews from people saying to buy directly from Apple and I was concerned but I took my chances and am overly impressed .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The case is now slightly larger than the previous generation , but the lack of an external power supply justifies the small increase in size .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O
I had to buy a wireless mouse to go with it , as I am old school and hate the pad , but knew that before I bought it , now it works great , need to get adjusted to the key board , as I am used to a bigger one and pounding .***O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O

I called apple and no solution .***O O O O O O O
It 's a decent computer for the price and hopefully it will last a long time .***O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O

A veryimportant feature is Firewire 800 which in my experience works better then USB3 in PC enabled with USB3 was not originally sold on the MAC OS I felt it was inferior in many ways To Windows 7 .***O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
