I was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they do n't have .***O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O
Too many other good places to have to settle .***O O O O O O O O O O
Not because you are The Four Seasons , you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romatic dinner .***O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food was excellent as well as service , however , I left The Four Seasons very dissappointed .***O T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O

Come on .***O O O
Do n't get me started on the margaritas , either .***O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O
Mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
Really , I find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds -- this , in the city of a million restaurants , at least 9/10 of which are way better than this one .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Save your money and your time and go somewhere else .***O O O O O O O O O O O

This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York .***O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O
Small , bright , and clean , BZ Grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints , both in Astoria and out .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What really makes it shine is the food , which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices , and all made in - house even the gyro meat and sausages , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected .***O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O T-POS O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O
All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent , but the gyro is the reason to come -- if you do n't eat one your trip was wasted .***O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

When we inquired about ports , the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost .***O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O

Maggot in the food !***O O O T-NEG O
I ' ve been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The menu looked great , and the waiter was very nice , but when the food came , it was average .***O T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O
Nevertheless , I finished my plate , and that 's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O
I showed it to the manager , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for .***O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When the bill came , nothing was comped , so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine , but I did n't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yes , I ate the food , but I certainly would not have if I had seen the maggot before eating , and I was at this point fairly sick to my stomach .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine which cost less than the food , and made it seem like a big concession .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We paid and left because we did n't feel like arguing any more .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot , and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O

I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant , and the food was majorly disappointing .***O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
Rather than eating the meat entree being offered , I requested a vegetarian dish .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Rather than preparing vegetarian dish , the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables minus sauce , seasoning , or any form or aesthetic presentation .***O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

This is a twenty - something guy that does n't mind laying down $ 300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But $ 500 for a dinner for two that did n't include Wine ?***O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O
Are you freaking kidding me ?***O O O O O O
Look , the appetizers were really good .***O O O T-POS O O O O
The entree was also very good .***O T-POS O O O O O
Ca n't argue about that , but they are clearly over priced .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What you are paying for is the environment and the name .***O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O
Yes , the place is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
$ 500 included ,***O O O O
Drinks , 2 glasses of Dom Perignon at $ 35 each .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
Starters , Kobe Beef Sashimi .***O O O O O O

Entrees , Vanison steak and Bison Steak .***O O O O O O O O
Vanison was good but not amazing .***T-NEU O O O O O O
Bison was quite excellent however .***T-POS O O O O O

Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself , but may be it is worth it .***O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I was wrong .***O O O O
The Four Seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say I ' ve been to the four seasons restaurant .***T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly , curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All in all , the food was great except for the dessserts .***O O O O O T-POS O O O O O T-NEG O
The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts .***O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If you are going for the food , it will not be worth it .***O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O

You would think they would make up for it with service , sadly , no .***O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
Service was just ok , it is not what you 'd expect for $ 500 .***T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience !***O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O
BUT not in a good way .***O O O O O O O
I am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time .***O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our visit their to say the least , was an unpleasant and costly experience !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O
Although we were told 10 - 15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The place is beautiful !***O T-POS O O O
The hostess was very pleasant .***O T-POS O O O O
However , our $ 14 drinks were were horrible !***O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
Once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Since we were already waiting so long , we felt we had no other choice but to accept it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our experience did not ever get any better .***O O O O O O O O O
For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka .***O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
After the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner .***O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O
We asked for beverages and never received them .***O O O O O O O O O
We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .***O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I would not expect this for a $ 55 dinner .***O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka some of which we never received ! .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses !***O O O O O O O O O O O O
To top it all off the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O
I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused , and wasted my hard earned money .***O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Do n't go with a larger group than 4 !***O O O O O O O O O O
I went here for a family birthday dinner .***O O O O O O O O O
Five of us walked in at approximately 6 , 20 on a Thursday evening .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The hostess said Wow that 's a large group , unless you are n't together , to which I replied no we are , and there will be one more , so a table for six please .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At first we were a little taken aback , as this seemed to present a problem , although the restaurant looked fairly empty , but they hastily put the table together for us .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The menu is fairly simple without much descriptions .***O T-NEU O O O O O O O
There was no tap beer that evening , which was a disappointment .***O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
Not much of a selection of bottled beer either , we went with Brahma .***O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O
The appetizers we ordered were served quickly , an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion maybe 3 of each .***O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
The lobster knuckles special of the day were ok , but pretty tasteless .***O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O
I believe there were 2 shrimp in the " salt encrusted shrimp " appetizer .***O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O
After we ate our appetizers which took all of 8 minutes we ordered another round of Brahma 's , and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She replied well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now , since you are a larger party , and it might get crowded .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We called the other person who was very close by , and she told us to order for her , so we did .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food arrived in about 15 minutes .***O O O O O O O O
I had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass was very good .***O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O
Everyone seemed generally happy with their food , except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi , seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice !***O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O
I heard the lobster roll was excellent .***O O O T-POS T-POS O O O
They seemed to continue to rush us along , taking plates without asking if we were done my sister still had her fork in hand .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All in all the food was good , a little on the expensive side , but fresh .***O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Service not the friendliest to our large party !***T-NEG O O O O O O O O

Very normal Indian food , but done really well .***O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O
I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price just chicken tikka masala , no bread of rice , is $ 25 , which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place does n't have an upscale feel .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O T-NEG O
Also , waiters try to push more food on you , like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $ .***O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I do n't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron 's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff more than the price .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But if you 're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary , then this is the place to go for Indian food***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O T-POS T-POS

For starters they delivered us someone else 's order .***O O O O O O O O O O
Fine , I wo nt hang you for that .***O O O O O O O O O O
However , once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair , sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option , I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Not one to jump to complaints hence my lack of previous online reviewing , I called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others , but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .***O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
None was made so i hung up .***O O O O O O O O
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
My girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal , called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

If you 're planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you 'll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's just you and your date and an occasional cute excuse me before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O
My party had the BBE $ 29 fixe prix menu , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake !***O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche .***O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O
Our first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce .***O O O O O O O O O O O
I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree , which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better .***O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O
The entrees were served with miso soup and rice .***O T-NEU O O O O O O O O
The sake 's complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For desserts , we tried the frozen black sesame mousse interesting but not extraordinary and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .***O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O
Maybe it was the great company I had friends visiting from Philly , yes , it was not a date this time or the super reasonable price point , but I just ca n't say enough good things about this brasserie .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
I do n't usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but I 'll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
Terrible would be a compliment !***O O O O O O
The service leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We were 10 people celebrtating a birthday , we sat in the tent .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing ! !***O O O O O O O O O O
We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !***O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O T-NEG T-NEG O

Great Shabu Shabu***O T-POS T-POS
I go here at least once every other week , particularly when it 's cold !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I love it .***O O O O
To be honest we only ever eat the Shabu Shabu .***O O O O O O O O O O O
I tried a couple other dishes but was n't too impressed .***O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O
But for the Shabu Shabu , you wo n't find much better in NY .***O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
In fact there is only one I ' ve tried that even compares shabu Tatsu and even then I prefer Dokebi .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The meat is fresh , the sauces are great , you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too .***O T-POS O O O O T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O T-POS O O O T-POS O T-POS O O O O
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one - two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos .***O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS T-POS O
The hot dogs are good , yes , but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich , perfect on its supermarket squishy bun .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O T-POS O

Price is high but the food is good , so I would come back again .***O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
This place does n't make any sense***O T-NEG O O O O O
Just want to warn you all , do n't waste your time and money .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This place has totally weird decor , stairs going up with mirrored walls , I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs , mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional .***O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O
This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird .***O T-NEG O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly does n't work .***O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
The food they serve is not comforting , not appetizing and uncooked .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
Go to japanese sushi place or Spanish tapas place , this creation in Williamsburg is a misstake .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Good Food***O T-POS
I went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary .***O O O O O O O O O O
The food was great and tasty , but the sitting space was too small , I do n't like being cramp in a corner .***O T-POS O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Over all it was a very nice romantic place .***O O O O O O O O T-POS O
I would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation if possible***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Loved it***O O
A coworker and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and loved it .***O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
The atmosphere was great .***O T-POS O O O
The food we ordered was excellent , although I would n't say the margaritas were anything to write home about .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O
Our waitress was n't mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .***O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O
I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year , though .***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O
Maybe it has improved since then ?***O O O O O O O
Regardless , we 'll be back and ca n't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
Dumbfoundingly Poor***O O
This was , from start to finish , a mind - bogglingly uncomfortable experience .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Lexicographers take note , a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Polite acknowledgement is out ;***O O O O O
supercilious scorn is in .***O O O O O
And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins , inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent ?***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A different server enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer which was delicious .***O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O
Overall the food quality was pretty good , though I hear the salmon is much better when it has n't sat cooling in front of the guest .***O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The place has a nice fit - out , some attractive furnishings and , from what I could tell , a reasonable wine list I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins***O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At $ 120 for two people , however , this in no way represents value , unless you 're looking to pay by the hour for passive - aggressive torture .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
On that scale , it 's a world - beater .***O O O O O O O O O O O
How is this palce still open ?***O O O T-NEG O O O
I honestly do n't even know where to begin .***O O O O O O O O O O
My boyfriend and I are avid restaurant goers , and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended Flatbush Farms .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We arrived and were seated immediately , which made us both happy .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We ordered our appetizers , I ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Everything was going good until we got our meals .***O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled .***O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
It was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes .***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead , while he de - skinned the chicken so that I could enjoy the white meat .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I took one bite from the $ 24 salmon , and I have never , in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms .***O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At this point , the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay , I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress WALKED away .***O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O
So , I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again , but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
I could n't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I ' ve had better chicken at BBQs ! ! ! !***O O O O O O O O O O O O
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Guess what , I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did , she says , oh well , I wish you would have said something earlier No apology , nothing .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After that she simply took our plates , walked away , came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No desert menu , no apology , nothing ! ! ! ! ! !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I was literally going to explode , but instead , my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is where it really really gets bad , the manager said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and I can not comp it .***O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Again , no apology , no is there anything else I can get you , no can I get you a drink to make up for it , nothing ! ! ! !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The level of rudeness was preposterous .***O O O O O O O
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS O O O O O

Casa La Femme is to middle eastern dining what Chuckie Cheeze is to italian .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Wellthey can run but they ca n't hide .***O O O O O O O O O
I live in the West Village and I ' ve been to a lot of restaurants .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sometimes you pay a lot and do n't get much in return , it 's manhattan , things are expensive .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , most of them are at least prompt and pleasant .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
This place where do i begin .***O T-NEG O O O O O
It is quite a spectacular scene i 'll give them that .***O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O

Only complaint is the pricing -- I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O

Each time we ' ve been , the front of house staff not the waiters , they 're fantastic , but the people who greet and seat you has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return .***O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O

I 'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely !***O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O
There 's another girl who I ca n't describe , she is about 5'6 with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in , except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're * really * talking about .***O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Again , I 'd be super upset if that were my employee .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , I expect better service .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
So , if you 're walking by and thinking about dining , you might want to see who 's going to be seating you first .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O T-NEG O O O O
On our last visit , they skipped over our name on the list , leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Without the wait or attitude , I would probably go back , but there are just too many other restaurants in Brooklyn that are as good or better and do n't make me jump through hoops .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The food is good .***O T-POS O O O
The design of the space is good .***O O O O T-POS O O O
But the service is HORRID !***O O T-NEG O O O
I was there for brunch recently , and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O T-NEG O
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I ca n't believe that it was , but please put the bag down before delivering food !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so I try to ignore it .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I could n't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends , who was in mid bite , to clear the table .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She then put the check down without asking if we were done , and came to check on the bill every two minutes , even though we were one of three occupied tables .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I wish I could like this place more , and I wish someone would retrain the staff .***O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
Yum !***O O
Serves really good sushi .***O O O T-POS O
Not the biggest portions but adequate .***O O O T-NEU O O O
Green Tea creme brulee is a must !***T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O
Do n't leave the restaurant without it .***O O O O O O O O
No Comparison***O O
I ca n't say enough about this place .***O O O O O O O T-POS O
It has great sushi and even better service .***O O O T-POS O O O T-POS O
The entire staff was extremely accomodating and tended to my every need .***O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
I ' ve been to this restaurant over a dozen times with no complaints to date .***O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
Snotty Attitude***O O
We were treated very rudely here one time for breakfast .***O O O O O O O O O O O
The owner is belligerent to guests that have a complaint .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
Good food !***O T-POS O
We love breakfast food .***O O O O O
This is a great place to get a delicious meal .***O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
We never had to wait more than 5 minutes .***O O O O O O O O O O
The staff is pretty friendly .***O T-POS O O O O
The onion rings are great !***O T-POS T-POS O O O
They are not greasy or anything .***O O O O O O O
Overrated***O
I was highly disappointed in the food at Pagoda .***O O O O O O T-NEG O O O
The lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns , the few they actually give youwere not good .***O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O
The prices are outrageous , especially since the food was actually less satisfying than most neighborhood Chinese establishments .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nice ambience , but highly overrated place .***O T-POS O O O O T-NEG O
I will not go back .***O O O O O O
Worst Service I Ever Had***O T-POS O O O
A group of 5 of us went there for Sunday brunch and sat outside .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service we had ever received .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
Our waiter was non - existent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered , we were not given any water or utensils .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I complained to the manager , but he was not even apologetic .***O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
I will never return again .***O O O O O O
Fabulous Italian Food !***O T-POS T-POS O
I highly recommend Mioposto .***O O O T-POS O
I am so happy to have a wonderful Italian restaurant in my neighborhood .***O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O
The wine list is wonderful and the food reminds me of my recent trip to Italy .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
I love this restaurant***O O O T-POS
I will never forget the amazing meal , service , and ambiance I experience at this restaurant .***O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS O O T-POS O O O O O O
It was absolutely amazing .***O O O O O
The wine list is incredible and extensive and diverse , the food is all incredible and the staff was all very nice , good at their jobs and cultured .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have not a bad thing to say about this place .***O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
AMAZING .***O O
I can not wait to go back again this coming weekend !***O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mmm good ! .***O O O O
Went there last night with a friend .***O O O O O O O O
She had heard from a co - worker about this place .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food was great !***O T-POS O O O
It 's * very * reasonably priced , esp for the quality of the food .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
I had the Kafta plate and it was perfect .***O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O
We 're going back , D .***O O O O O O O
Finally a meal that you will remember for a long time !***O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
In a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants , its nice to see a place that bucks that trend , and just plain delivers high quality food and good service , period .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O T-POS O O O
This is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality food the industry can offer .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O
Caution , its real food for people who love the best .***O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O
Some of the food is clearly oriented toward foodies like me so if your not a foodie nothing wrong with that head over to McDonalds or some Ruby Tuesday and have at it !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If your looking for real quality not the BS that is seen on yelp ratings , which allegedly recently got in trouble for adjusting ratings , you need to get in here !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Very Disappointing***O O
I took my parents here for their anniversary - very very disappointed ! ! !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the price .***O O O T-POS O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O
I may not be a sushi guru but I can tell you that the food here is just okay and that there is not much else to it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Rice is too dry , tuna was n't so fresh either .***T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O
Nothing really came across as outstanding .***O O O O O O O
Very disappointed .***O O O
I have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O
However , the value and service are both severely lacking .***O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
Portions contain less fish than one would expect , particularly since prices are in line with the best sushi places in NYC Masa excluded , of course .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , while the fish is unquestionably fresh , rolls tend to be inexplicably bland .***O O O O T-POS O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O
The service ranges from mediocre to offensive .***O T-NEG O O O O O O
On a recent trip , our waiter was extremely dismissive , while no less than three staff members waited hand - and - foot on a pair of Japanese girls seated nearby .***O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We were then charged for their most expensive sake $ 20 + per serving when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But I m sure this was just an honest mistake .***O O O O O O O O O O O
Freshest sushi , I love this restaurant .***O T-POS O O O O T-POS O
They pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex rolls .***O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS O
The sashimi was the freshest and most tender I have ever tasted .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
Their apps are all delicious .***O T-POS O O O O
The only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side .***O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O
But the space is small and lovely , and the service is helpful .***O O T-POS O O O O O O O T-POS O O O
You are bound to have a very charming time .***O O O O O O O O O O
Not recommanded ! ! !***O O O O O
The food was not great & the waiters were rude .***O T-NEG O O O O O T-NEG O O O
It is not worth going at all and spend your money there ! ! !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great service***O T-POS
Pretty cheap for sit down Mexican AND downtown .***O O O O O O O O O
my service was stellar !***O T-POS O O O
the bus boy even spotted that my table was shaking a stabilized it for me .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
food was fine , with a some little - tastier - than - normal salsa .***T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
If you 're in the area you should n't be disappointed .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ok , Maybe I went in on someone 's bad day .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
the food was great , the margaritas too but the waitress was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me .***O T-POS O O O O T-POS O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Took forever to get our order taken , water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I do n't know if I 'll be back .***O O O O O O O O O O
Mama Mia , I live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
the only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before it 's edible , even when you order ahead .***O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
BUt once done , it 's not too much dough , not too much cheese , not too much sauce .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Best Sushi in town .***O T-POS O O O
Have gone to all the top places .***O O O O O O O O
Everything you want and more , very fresh .***O O O O O O O O O
Its worth the wait , especially since they 'll give you a call when the table is ready .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The best calamari in Seattle !***O O T-POS O O O
and the best summertime deck experience -- they will even bring you a blanket if you get cold in the Seattle evening weather .***O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A perfect place to take out of town guests any time of the year .***O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
Endless fun , awesome music , great staff ! ! !***O O O O T-POS O O T-POS O O O
By far the best bar in the east village .***O O O O T-POS O O O O O
I went there with some friends one night to play bingo and watch the sox game and it was a blast !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Every time 0-sixtynine is called the bartender buys everyone drinks !***O O O O O O T-POS O O O O
Been there lots since and its always a good time .***O O O O O O O O O O O
Great draft and bottle selection and the pizza rocks .***O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O T-POS O O

The sushi here is delicious !***O T-POS O O O O
They have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from ; Atlantic or Pacific .***O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I ' ve had the Jellyfish , Horse Mackerel , Blue Fin Tuna and the Sake Ikura roll among others , and they were all good .***O O O O O T-POS O T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O
My only negative comment is that I wish the pieces were a little bigger .***O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
The decor is rustic , traditional Japanese .***O T-NEU O O O O O O
The crowd is mixed yuppies , young and old .***O T-NEU O O O O O O O O
The service was courteous and attentive .***O T-POS O O O O O
Mediocre food***O T-NEU
We ate on the outside patio area for dinner on a Saturday night .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The outside patio area has an abbreviated menu .***O O O O O O O T-NEU O
We ordered the marinated grapes , buffalo style chicken wings , and the turkey sandwich .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
My g / f and I both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price .***O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
We are locals , and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one - time customer tourists .***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
Service was decent .***T-NEU O O O
Drinks were good .***T-POS O O O
Unless you are just stopping in for a few drinks I would n't recommend going here .***O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O
You are likely to be disappointed .***O O O O O O O
Excellent food , nice ambience , fairly expensive***O T-POS O O T-POS O O O
I loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi 5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes .***O O O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O
The ambiance was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in Downtown Disney .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was romantic , and even nice even with my sister , reminded me of Italy , and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a Mediterrean villa .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
I recommend it for a night when you want to splurge ! it was a bit expensive***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Best Indian food in LA .***O T-POS T-POS O O O
I ' ve been to over a dozen Indian places in LA , and this is still my favorite .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The best thing is , the prices are also quite reasonable .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
The chicken curry and chicken tikka masala are my favorite meat dishes .***O T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
The chana masala ( garbanzo beans ) are also excellent .***O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O
It 's located in a strip mall near the Beverly Center , not the greatest location , but the food keeps me coming back for more .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU O O O T-POS O O O O O O O

I think I have probably tried each item on their menu at least once it is all excellent .***O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O
I can highly recommend their various saag and paneer and korma .***O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS O T-POS O
You routinely see Indian families and friends dining there , which is always a good sign .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I appreciate their delivery too .***O O O T-POS O O
Nice food but no spice !***O T-POS O O O O

I had yummy lamb korma , saag paneer , samosas , naan , etc .***O O O T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS O T-POS O T-POS O O O
The food was all good but it was way too mild .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
Normally , places ask how hot you want it , but they did n't .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food to be that mild .***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
I will give them another chance and make sure to tell them to kick it up several notches .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The naan was some of the best I ' ve had and I really enjoyed the bhartha , not too tomatoey .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O
Even the chickpeas , which I normally find too dry , were good .***O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
And they packaged everything nicely so it did n't spill .***O O O O O O O O O O O
awesome find***O O
I do n't understand how I was a stranger to this place for so long the fajita salad , the colorado , the fajitas , EVERYTHING is delicious .***O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS O O T-POS O O O O O

The open sesame combo plate is a bargain for the heap of food given .***O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
The side of potatoes is to die for , as is the labne ( yogurt dip ) .***O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O
Also , they serve THE best hummus in America , with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil which , I believe is the traditional way !***O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow service .***O O O O O O T-NEG O O O T-NEG O
There have been several occasions when we ' ve just not gotten some side dishes we ' ve ordered .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

great beer***O T-POS
My first time to dine at this restaurant was with my son and it was absolutely horrible !***O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O
We waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and over 1 1/2 hours for our food .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre meal .***O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O T-NEG O
HOWEVER , one Sunday afternoon my husband and I did go although with my loud protests and were pleasantly surprised .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The band was very good and the service was attentive .***O T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O O
Outside in the area between the restaurant and the park , children were running around while their parents sipped wine .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We ordered a selection of the small plates , and the shoe string onions , goat cheese pizza , grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good .***O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O

We have since returned and also had a great experience , sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer cold and good .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O
We did have the same waiter the second time , so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good .***O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

NOT THE PLACE IT ONCE WAS***O O T-NEG O O O
It is sad to see a place that was once THE place to meet and eat for Bfast or Lunch , now be the place that is a big DONT BOTHER .***O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O

What may be interesting to most is the worst sevice / attitude comes from the owners of this establishment .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
This establishment really made a marked decline after and this is recurring story the airing of FOOD TELEVISIONS DINERS , DRIVE - INS , AND DIVES hosted by Guy Fieri , in which Schooner or Later was subject of .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Perhaps now , Scooner or Later falls into the Dive category .***O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O
This is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I hope one day Scooner or Later returns to what it once was .***O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O

First of all , I am not from Long Beach .***O O O O O O O O O O O
I was visiting SoCal a couple of months ago when the friend I was visiting decided to take me to this restaurant .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She was actually going to take me to another mediterranean restaurant right across the street but they were not open yet even though it was a few minutes past their opening time .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Service was kind of slow , our waitress took forever to give us our check even though it was n't that busy .***T-NEG O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Still I would recommend this place .***O O O O O T-POS O

My family went on a midweek evening to have dinner .***O O O O O O O O O O O
The restaurant was 80 % full and there was a sign posted wait to be seated .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well I guess it 's hard to be seated when one is invisible to the staff .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
We stood there for 10 minutes while employees walked back and forth ignoring us .***O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O
Finally , my wife stood face to face in front of one of the staff and she asked , Are you waiting for a table ?***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
Once seated it took about 30 minutes to finally get the meal .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The pizza was slightly reminescent of Baker 's Beach pizza which occupied the the space years ago a distant second .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was decent but nothing exceptional .***O O O O O O O
This establishment is consistent with my feelings of the rest of Chow Foods group .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We used to frequent most of their restaurants but over the years each one has really been disapointing .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I ' m a born and bred Southend resident and was excited to hear of this restaurant opening .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Poor customer service pizza .***O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O
As with most restaurants in Seattle , Mioposto 's service was bad and the food was overpriced .***O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O O O
I know many people have their favorite types of pizza and pizza places , but Mioposto 's pizza lacks quality and good taste .***O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O T-NEG O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O
To be honest , I ' ve had better frozen pizza .***O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
I ' m not kidding .***O O O O O O
The only positive thing about Mioposto is the nice location .***O O O O O T-NEG O O O T-POS O
Love it every time***O O O O
I was frankly shocked when I read the bad reviews , this place is fantastic ; it has not let us down in any way , and we ' ve eaten here more than 10 times .***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
People complain about the dim lighting , but that is one what I love about this place , if you want to stare at your food in bright light , go to McDonalds .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food is fantastic , and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time we ' ve been there .***O T-POS O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O

COMPLETELY OVER RATED !***O O O O
I will have to do more research before checking out new places based on Diners , drive - ins and dives reviews .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I noice most reviews mention the bad service .***O O O O O O O O O
The food was ok , but the service was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served .***O T-NEU O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O
Even then , the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We had a very hard time getting the waitress attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager .***O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20 % discount on our bill .***O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When the bill came , he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was clear he did n't really care .***O O O O O O O O O
With so many great breakfast / lunch places in So Cal , this one is not worth the wait or any extra effort to visit .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
AVOID THE PLACE***O O T-NEG
Save yourself the waste of time & DO NOT visit .***O O O O O O O O O O O
I made my 1st trip to the restaurant after finding their webpage online .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When I got there I sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the service was horrible !***O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O T-NEG O O O
I waited for 10 - 15 minutes for service ordered a beer & was never served again .***O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
After sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes I left .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I went home & looked them up online again where I discovered there is a link for a give away that does n't work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service & deceptive link .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
I never heard back from anyone more than a month ago .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
After telling my friend about the situation he said lets try again but we will visit the lower bar .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the bar keep had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she 'd be right with us .***O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We left without ever getting service .***O O O O O T-NEG O
As of writing this I just tried their give away a link again & it still does n't work .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There are so many better places to visit !***O O O O O O O O O
Best Crab Cakes in Town***O T-POS T-POS O O

Great Pizza , Poor Service***O T-POS O O T-NEG
Love their pizza , especially the mushroom pizza .***O O T-POS O O O O T-POS O
Also love their caeser salad .***O O O T-POS T-POS O
Prefer to order it and pick it up though because I do n't like the servers , one young woman in particular .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O
She does n't make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But she is very friendly with certain people , making it even more annoying .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners .***T-NEG O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O
Many people talk about the great pizza and poor service , so it ca n't just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers .***O O O O O O T-POS O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service were n't so impersonal and corporate - like .***O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O

best chinese food i have tasted in a long time***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O
we got a groupon for pagoda and decided to try it on a thursday night .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there was a guy playing the piano and singing at the bar area which was separate from the dinning area .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
we ordered the honey walnut prawns which we always order at every chinese restaurant to determine the quality of food .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
First off , the food came fast and all together , i like that i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so about the prawns , they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter soooo good the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
yummy .***O O
best honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted .***O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
next one that we ordered were prawns and scallop with brocolli .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
the brocollis were so fresh and tasty .***O T-POS O O O O O O
i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time , every piece was as eventful as the first one the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked .***O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS O O O O O O O
not chewy at all .***O O O O O
for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee oh la la yummy ! ! ! .***O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O
melt in your mouth .***O O O O O
we are for sure coming back to this restaurant .***O O O O O O O O T-POS O
every month if possible .***O O O O O
it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel but they are definitely one you do n't want to miss , esp if your in downtown san jose .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Chintzy portions***O T-NEG
The sushi here is perfectly good , but for $ 5 a piece , either the slices of fish should be larger , or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant even for NYC .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
We easily spent more than $ 40 per person not including alcohol and were still hungry .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I ' m astonished that this restaurant is categorized as $ $ $ rather than $ $ $ $ .***O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Terrible service , food ok , pricey***O T-NEG O T-NEU O O O
This past weekend had great weather for San Francisco standards .***O O O O O O O O O O O
So for the after beach excursion ' , we thought we would end the day on a high note and make the trip across the street from the beach to Park Chalet .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The restaurant was busy , however there were a few tables open .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it 'd be a 30 minute wait .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So here we are , my wife , 3 year old daughter and I trying to pass the time by hanging out in the front of the building where the murals and artifacts are .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
30 minutes went by and sure enough the pager buzzer went off .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We went back to the restaurant and low and behold , we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago ! !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Logic behind that ?***O O O O
None that I can think of .***O O O O O O O
We put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers , the food did n't arrive until 45 minutes laterWITH OUR MAIN COURSE .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Um so now what are appetizers for ? ? ?***O O O O O O O O O O
Oh I forgot to mention that they do n't have bread service .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Its a good thing my daughter had some snacks in her lunch bag .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
My wife also ordered a teapot of hot water she had a sore throat and I guess that since it was only water , it was n't a priority for them to actually bring it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In other words , if they are n't making $ $ off of you then you do n't rate high on their service scale ' .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O
Food wise , its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant is n't a fancy place .***T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O
The upside of the restaurant ?***O O O O O O
If I needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or Golden Gate park .***O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O
Its great if you spent the day there and did n't want to drive to eat .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Parking is reasonably good , they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides .***O O O O O T-POS O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O
I 'd hate for tourists to go to Park Chalet and think that this is how all San Francisco restaurants are like .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

A sushi - fiend friend recently visited and our group of three just had to come for dinner .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
6 pm on a Sat before a Broadway play and we were quickly seated and served .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Very poor customer service .***O O T-NEG T-NEG O
Schooner or Later 's charming location along the marina in Long Beach and average food does not , unfortunately , compensate for its very poor customer service .***O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
While this diner had reasonably good food , the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence , and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service .***O O O O O O T-POS O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As part of a small party of four , our food was dropped off without comment ;***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When we finally were able to flag someone down , it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food , who was also not the same person who had taken our order .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress , a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant .***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
A brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment -- to say we had been blown off would be an understatement .***O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The manager continually interrupted with Is there anything else I can do for you ? , a strange comment because she had hardly listened , let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
She promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage , but we could hardly take her promise seriously , seeing as she had n't bothered to get the waitresses name .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In short , Schooner or Later could n't have cared less about our being at their establishment .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

We were quickly seated and requested the special dinner , which came with , 1 Shellfish and Shrimp appetizer or Caesar Salad , 2 9 oz steak with a single potato chip , and 3 homemade donut holes .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I got the shellfish and shrimp appetizer and it was alright .***O O O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O
It was n't the freshest seafood ever , but the taste and presentation was OK .***O O O O O T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O
Before the steak came , the server told us that the steak did not come with any sides and suggested I pick something from the menu .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I picked the asparagus , which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
It was steamed and tossed with garlic .***O O O O O O O O
The 9 oz steak came next and it tasted great , at least initially .***O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
The steak was done to my exact liking medium rare and was nice and juicy .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It ? s served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction , though both were indistinguishable in taste .***O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O T-NEU T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O
Though , one thing I realized later on was that the restaurant either used MSG or a meat tenderizer on the steak .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
My mouth felt very dry afterwards and I had that signature ? MSG ? taste lingering in my throat after I left the restaurant .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Finally , the homemade donut holes were served for desert .***O O O O O O O O O O O
They came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting ; very light and not - too - sweet .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O T-POS O
The dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip , almost $ 50 / pp after tax and tip about average .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But the servers were extremely attentive and very friendly .***O O T-POS O O O O O O O

Mediocre Service***O T-NEU
This review is for the Southglen location which is not listed in Citysearch , I wish this review would make a difference enough for it to be addressed by management but Snooze has people climbing over each other for a chance to eat at this overpriced restaurant with mediocre food and service , so this review as well as the other negative ones for their Larimer location will go unaddressed .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The presentation of Snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there ; but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced IHOP with a high brow menu .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
To start off , approximately 8 - 10 oz of orange juice will cost you $ 3 .***O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O
They serve it in a tall , skinny hour - glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
I should have just asked for the check when I saw that ; but their menu was so unique that I continued .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O
The pancakes were certainly inventive but $ 850 for 3 , 6 pancakes one of them was more like 5 in the pancake flight sample of 3 different pancakes is well over - priced .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O
The pancakes should be larger at least 8 to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The flavors were good but I have had far better pancakes at a German pancake specialty restaurant that were a little cheaper but significan'tly larger .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
On my meal I had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking , and would have had to send them back again if I had n't rejected the meal all together .***O O T-NEG O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O
I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and I was too frustrated to continue .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
To their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
In the end our check came to $ 27 for 4 small pancakes , a breakfast burrito , an orange juice and an iced tea I had water .***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O T-NEG T-NEG O O T-NEG T-NEG O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O
This was 2 times what the same meal would have cost at Le Peep .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Our server continued to be attentive throughout the night , but I did remain puzzled by one issue , Who thinks that Ray 's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner ?***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEU T-NEU O O O O O O O O O O O
Two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinnerthey were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Given that Ray 's is a seafood restaurantwell , you get the idea .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All considered , I have to say that Ray 's Boathouse is deserving of its title as a Seattle institution .***O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
While I could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us , our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS O O O O O O O O
