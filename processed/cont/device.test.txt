when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

apex 's website is down and they wo n't answer their phone .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .***O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O

like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively - intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60 gb nomad xtra is " sold out " or more likely " discontinued " at the almighty amazon.com ?***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
granted it is a little more than the zen , it is well worth it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

these are minor problems , and i list them to save anyone else the trouble of discovering them .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i have had this phone for about 5 months .***O O O O O O O O O O
the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i ' ve ever encountered .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .***O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O

if you buy the stereo headset , you will enjoy it much more .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw . and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod , that crap sucks big donkey ..... never mind .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
seriously ! i love it !***O O O O O O
plays them all .***O O O O
bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful ASPECT#3s to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .***O O O O O T-POS O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O T-POS O T-POS T-POS O
please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .***O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
it 's been so long since i ' ve had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .***O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
works great !***T-POS O O
i ve seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .***O O T-POS O O O O T-POS O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O
3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .***O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .***O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
we are overall pleased with product .***O O O O O T-POS O
i love having the option to manually control the f - stop , shutter speed and even focus .***O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .***O T-POS O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the fm radio is cool .***O T-POS T-POS O O O
it is connected to an old television set via composite video and analog audio outputs .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .***O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O
the pro ...***O O O
after all those players have 40 - 60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .***O O O O O O T-POS O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O
when the player was working it was great , but .***O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
i had apex regular ( non - progressive ) dvd - player for two years .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 ) folders can not be created for the audio files .***O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
i chose the canon speedlite 420 .***O O O O O O O
the battery is nice .***O T-POS O O O
take the time to fill in those tags !***O O O O O O O O O
a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re - install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
well that was not a simple task .***O O O O O O O O
thumbs down on that one .***O O O O O O
be advised , however , that you may encounter problems .***O O O O O O O O O O O
comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .***O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O
i ' ve bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this***O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
i just got it today and have tried to verify the claims of other reviewers .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's not a big deal for me .***O O O O O O O O O
my gut tells me i 'll also end up buying an ipod .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a few things that might make it even better :***O O O O O O O O O O
cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
despite all the hype about ipods , i knew i wanted something different , because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer , and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i finally returned the unit to the company along with copies of my messages and return info .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am averaging 4.5 mb per song , to give you an idea of how many songs you can get by the amount of memory .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i expect the g3 will please me for years to come .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more )***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i replaced it with this not - quite - so - dazzling , but definitely more functional device .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .***O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the interface used could be better designed .***O T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O
1 ) fm receiver - some models out there have this .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .***O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
i will say this .***O O O O O
to my amazement , even that process was error - prone .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per - gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can ' t simply bring up my entire list of songs , click play , and then hit next .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t - mobile " hot - spots " .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted a dvd player that had basic features and would be able to play dvd - r format disc 's that i had made myself .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , you can store data on it , which is a plus . for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can not stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the lense is a lot better , and the 4 mb produce fantastic pictures .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' m really happy with this purchase .***O O O O O O O O O
i ' m giving this player cautious recommendation .***O O O O O T-POS O O O
i bought the apex ad-2600 dvd player for the family for christmas .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )***O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now let 's talk about the software .***O O O O O O O O
i bought the player this week and i like it by far .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
i received this as a gift for christmas .***O O O O O O O O O
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
go for it !***O O O O
you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .***O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was trying to decide whether or not i should go with the 40 gb ipod or this 30 gb zen xtra .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if i could give this a negative rating , i would .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
that was annoying .***O O O O
well i decided to get this one .***O O O O O O O O
i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .***O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .***O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera .***O O O O O O O O O O
a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .***O O T-POS O O O T-POS O O T-NEG O O T-NEG O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
i do n't think so .***O O O O O O
before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .***O T-POS O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .***T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i ' m convinced it 's the best one out there .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
song transfers were not an issue .***O O O O O O O
it does n't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
i 'd like to see how well a small company supports its mp3 player in 2 years when its battery dies as all rechargeable do .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a very amazing product .***O O O O O T-POS O
it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .***O O O O T-POS O O O O O O T-POS O O O
3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought my nikon coolpix4300 about a week ago .***O O O O O O O O O O
it wo n't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store boughten .***O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love it ! !***O O O O O
in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro - focussing option to shoot wonderful close - up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .***O T-POS T-POS O O O T-POS O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying .***O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O
not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the prior one looked and felt lightweight , cheesy , and assembled by the oppressed :***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .***O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i saw another review saying his only gripe was a lack of voice dialing .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
warning - i did read the manual !***O O O O O O O O
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .***O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
having 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .***O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O
about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god .***O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O
point the " media sniffer " to your music files and let it do the rest .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
recently i accidently washed my telephone with my laundry through two complete 18 minute wash cycles of a washing machine .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product .***O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so much packed in a small case and very affordable !***O O O O O O T-POS O O O O
the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .***O O O O T-NEG O O O O O T-NEG O
also , if you 're an audiophile , you 'll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is a good deal for music and data storage .***O O O O T-POS O T-POS O T-POS T-POS O
the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .***O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O T-POS O O O O T-POS O
there was very little light in there .***O O O O O O O O
it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .***O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the best ASPECT#1 / ASPECT#2 available and fairly easy to use .***O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
flash - as with all built - in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .***O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this player seems to work fine with everything else .***O T-POS O O T-POS O O O O O

some things that i did n't like ( but hey . nothing is perfect ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i ' ve been waiting 27 days . )***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as it is , i ' m keeping the machine .***O O O O O O O O O O O
all i am looking for is a rebate form !***O O O O O O O O O O
within months they stopped supporting the new mac os .***O O O O O O O O O O
i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we also looked at the fuji fps602 .***O O O O O O O O
guess where this unit is headed ?***O O O O O O O

- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend this product to anyone .***O O O O T-POS O O O

if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed , i would rate this a 5 star machine .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if the dvd is stopped , it will display " playback only " .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i ' m no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .***T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .***O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O
after having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply would n't perform .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O T-NEG O O O
nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .***O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .***O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
also , they 'd forgotten to add " wap " capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4 - 5 days of figuring out .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .***O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far the software for the pc works easily .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O
the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent ASPECT#2s / ASPECT#3s , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230 kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .***O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .***O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O
overall i like it .***O O O O O
it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .***O O O O T-POS O O O O T-POS O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
i love photography .***O O O O
you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re - classify things later .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i ' ve used before .***O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
best electronic i ' ve bought since i was born .***O O O O O O O O O O O
the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i ' m not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com .***O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
maybe more competitors will bring out similar products .***O O O O O O O O O
it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
c. i do love audio sync which allows a one - click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer .***O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
crappy headphones .***O T-NEG O
i just sold my archos 20 gb jukebox recorder after not being satisfied with it 's slow loading & difficult navigation , not to mention it froze quite a bit .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the device is larger than an ipod of similar capacity .***O O O O O O O O O O O
to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had no problem what - so - ever with this product .***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
who cares if it does n't have multiple slots ?***O O O O O O O O O O
this player is an ideal purchase .***O T-POS O O O O O
small problem .***O O O
it 's probably good for the health of your ears , however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range ( and my hearing is fine ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .***O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i should n't have been cheap , should have bought a toshiba .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
here were my requirements in a digital camera :***O O O O O O O O O
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent ASPECT#1s -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve had no problems at all so far and i ' m very happy .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we 'll see if i need them to .***O O O O O O O O O
it is light weight , sleek and attractive .***O O O T-POS O O O O O
i have not yet tried the cd - ripping program .***O O O O O O O O O O O
it also has an optical out , which it should .***O O O O O O O O O O O
although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .***O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now , for the t - mobile service :***O O O O O O O O O
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O
it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O
but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .***O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O
and since i ' m out here i can ' t mail it back under my 90 days and they wo n't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O
it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .***O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' m editing my review , because now i wish i read the manual before returning the player i bought for my girlfriend .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !***O O O O O O O O O O
vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .***O T-POS O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the vibration is not top .***O T-NEG O O O O
now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school !***O O O O O O O O O O O O

technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !***O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the physical appearance of this apex compared to one previous ( ad1100w ) is most appreciated .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software***O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS O T-POS T-POS O O O O O T-NEG
and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .***O O O O O T-POS O O O T-POS O O T-POS O
it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear - piece which is included .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O
i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .***O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O
7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .***O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased the ad2600 after feeling comfortable with the reviews i read here on amazon .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ASPECT#1s are a snap and quick .***O O O O O O O
frequent signal searches eat up battery power .***O O O O O O O O
the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
before they are sold out !***O O O O O O
i highly recommend this phone to anyone .***O O O O T-POS O O O
apex does n't answer the phone .***O O O O O O O
we saw reviews that said the same thing , and also saw here that their customer service stinks .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city / exchange you wanted .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the storage capacity is great .***O T-POS T-POS O O O
scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .***O T-NEG O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my story is based on personal usage .***O O O O O O O O
so i contacted customer service at creative , but they said , " if the product seems broken , we can not help , " or something to that effect .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they are not wowable good .***O O O O O O
( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .***O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
i simply love this feature .***O O O O O O
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .***O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O
some of my friends had well branded dvd - players but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now we come to the zen xtra .. .***O O O O O O O O O
apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the entire unit was poorly crafted .***O O T-NEG O O T-NEG O
i also got myself a 512 mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3 lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i ' ve taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had this dvd player for about 3 months now .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .***T-POS O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yes , i have red - eye off , and yes , i ' ve tried adding a flash .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they look fantastic .***O O O O
get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS T-POS O O O T-POS T-POS O T-POS O O O O O
i highly recommend the accessory kit , which provides you with everything else you need :***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
though we were past the deadline for returns ( by a few days ) , i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and then it just froze and now i ' m out $ 300 for their piece of junk .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and also , it 's priced very affordably .***O O O O O T-POS O O O
back to the 2600 :***O O O O O
best regards sadoun satellite sales***O O O O O
we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O T-POS O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this phone is highly recommended otherwise .***O T-POS O O O O O
many reviewers refer to it as " clunky " or " difficult " - heed their warnings .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can ' t speak to its long - term reliability , as i ' ve only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .***O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O
the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style , size , and ease of use .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great features . .***O O O O

several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !***O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i just got a 40 gb ipod to replace my zen ( a 20 gb model ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
of course , unlike that person i will mention that i upgraded the firmware to 1.23 . 00 . but i did transfer files before the upgrade without problem too .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .***O O T-POS T-POS O O O T-POS O O O O O O O

this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce - flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .***T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i bought the apex ad-2600 because of the ability to play jpegs and it seemed like it was the most bang for the buck .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .***O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O
a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS T-POS O
the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .***O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .***O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
bought the apex ad-2600 from amazon in 12/03 mainly on price , $ 49.99 - $ 10 rebate $ 39.99 .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ipod uses a smaller ( and more expensive ) drive ( 1.8 " ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
great camera .***O T-POS O
the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it is nt , its because you ve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the cd just has too many problems with win xp .***O O O O O O O O O O O
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery - powered appliance .***O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that , an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because there s nothing wrong and everything right with it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
the player hangs up on file transfer every once - in - a - while , prompting a reset .***O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
perhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i definately recommend a large memory card .***O O O O O O O O

after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i - pod was .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the pros :***O O O
the first one would n't work from the start .***O O O O O O O O O O
relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat ASPECT#2s with ugly hot spots .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 ) you must press the play button and hold it for a couple of seconds otherwise it will not work and you will think the whole unit is broken .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am quite happy with the camera .***O O O O O O T-POS O
after os froze twice on me in the subway i returned the jukebox .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i just received my 40 gb zen xtra yesterday and i ' m extremely pleased with it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for example , i tried playing my new " pirates of the carribean " extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O
in a quick summation , here is what i found .***O O O O O O O O O O O
advanced ASPECT#1s will find more creative control than imaginable .***O O O O O O O O O O
the included earbuds were uncomfortable .uncomfortable -1***O O T-NEG O O O O
playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .***T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .***O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .***O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do n't waste your money .***O O O O O O
working for 10 hours with it on " shuffle " totally rocks ! !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong .***O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .***O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard - drive based player***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i ' ve seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor ; not major ones though ,***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- large easy readable screen***O O O O T-POS
after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd .***O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O
i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i did nt really need one .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my recommendation is to wait on buying one from this company as they will surely get sent a message of many returned dvd players after christmas 2003 .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because i ve never seen anything better within its resolution limits .***O O O O O O O T-POS O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
very large pics take 8 mb each !***O O O O O O O O
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this product is too fragile for normal use .***O O O O O O O O O

my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing .***O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .***O O O O O O O O T-NEG O T-NEG O
at least once you ve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what i ve read , is better than just about anything else available .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately it turns out to be the " disposable " type .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
really happy with this little camera .***O O O O O T-POS O
sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .***O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately " fine * * " picture quality " image size : 1600 .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the radio :***O O O
- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .***O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there have been other occurrences of locking , but i will not bore you with the details .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
this camera will stay with me for years !***O O O O O O O O O
the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
the player works well with my sony srs - a 202 powered speakers .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft .***O O O O O O O O O O
the tiny ( postage - stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .***O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
very simple to use .***O O O T-POS O

the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself does nt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can ' t be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5 " hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and does n't need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr - like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the ASPECT#3s a touch of brilliance .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O
i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

comes with standard rca jacks for output , along with s - video output ( s - video cable not included , must be purchased seperately ) and also component video outputs .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
anyway , on with the review .***O O O O O O O
after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are a couple things i did nt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10 - 15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can see the lens barrel in the view - finder .***O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O

the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what you d want to do most of the time anyhow .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd - r data disk without vcd formatting .***O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O

the good news is if you can ' t get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

finally the software ASPECT#2d to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .***O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O T-POS O O O O O O T-POS O
many before me have done that already .***O O O O O O O O

he spent another half hour on the phone with tech support , to no avail .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged .***O O O O O O O O O O O
the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
this required patience as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it ( which i could do with my flash player ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

there is probably an easier way to do this , i just have n't found it yet .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel***O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice .***O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O

slowly yet surely my unit engorged as i read my own review , similar to when i look in the mirror .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can ' t praise it highly enough .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for me the sound of the music is what is important .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod .***O O T-POS T-POS O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O
the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .***O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i first bought a 6 gig nomad jukebox ( original ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O

the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality is excellent ( and i ' m fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can highly recommend this product becaASPECT#1 of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O T-POS O
the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the ASPECT#1s are amazing .***O O O O O
just received this camera two days ago and already love the ASPECT#1s it has .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this as a gift for my sister .***O O O O O O O O O O
yes , the picture quality and ASPECT#2s which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .***O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my sister was able to figure it out on her own as well , and she is of average computer competence .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as said before this works perfectly .***O O O O O O O
i ' m not sure if it would survive a fall from 3 feet .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that " creates " folders , documents and programs can ' t be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .***O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first there 's the unit itself .***O O O O O O O
one horrible flaw , or mayybe more than one .***O O O O O O O O O O
the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i ' ve seen .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
finally , i reiterate my thumbs - down rating for t - mobile as a carrier .***O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O
even at the " normal " setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a " digital " .***O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one downside : as of this writing , t - mobile has n't updated their t - zone system to fully support the 6610 .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O

when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc . .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .***O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O
the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile .***O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend replacing the existing software with the " notmad explorer , " which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
