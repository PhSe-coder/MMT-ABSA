there should have been a recall on this product .***O O O O O O O O O O
my last mp3 player 's screen drove me nuts .***O O O O O O O O O O
since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money - saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built - in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O

would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t - zones for that ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .***O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS O O T-POS T-POS O O O O T-POS O

the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40 gb ipod , is excellent .***O T-POS O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
by pressing p / n , you should be able to get a good picture on the screen .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem ca nt easily be solved .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
i think you get what you pay for stands true .***O O O O O O O O O O O

by the way my alias dvds are legit too not no bootleg from the internet .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was able to easily copy 2 gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
especially useful with portraits and difficult - to - meter situations .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working .***O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O
the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

( this includes the $ 20 that you have to pay up front , just to get them to look at your player . )***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that is a major minus , but its not that bad .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .***O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
the second one was the 2500 which i think is better than the 2600 because it has more features such as karoake which i do use sometimes for parties .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
its fast - forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i ' ve had .***O T-POS T-POS T-POS O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular ASPECT#2s .***O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O

e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage***O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f - stop yourself .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you 're a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock - bottom price , i highly recommend this model .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i ' ve tried playing all of these discs and they all play great .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw .***O O O O O O O O O O O
i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .***O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
but i would expect that , since my movie discs have all played with no problem , the extras discs would , too , without any additional tweaking .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they refunded my $ $ $ so fast and paid for the shipping back .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i downloaded the trial version , and after less than 10 minutes of using it , decided it was well worth the price .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
i would recommend a larger compact - flash card , at least 128 mb .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O
that 's why you have these things that can be keychain size .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the g3 ASPECT#1s like a work of art !***O O O O O O O O O
5 ) handle the player with care - it is not meant to be dropped .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .***O O O O O T-POS O O O O O T-NEG O O O
it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs .***O O O O O O O O O O
i finally joined the 21st century and bought this dvd player .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going .***O O O O T-NEG O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i compared this to a lot of other ASPECT#1s , believe me , it 's value for money .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then . .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question .***O O O O O O O O O O O
the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .***O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most aesthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs , mine has run well , and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .***O O O O O O O O O O O O

i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t - mobile .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is easy to " focus " in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the other cameras were great and i ' m sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

fair warning - do not buy .***O O O O O O O
very cheaply made .***O O O O

what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O T-NEG O
i was impressed by this very inexpensive ASPECT#1.for the first three hours , and then it died .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was surprised by t - mobile 's service .***O O O O O O O O O O
and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were " ?

i have to rip everything as a 160 kbps wma file ( as opposed to 128 kbps mp3 ) to avoid hearing digital garbling .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .***O O O O T-POS O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O
i also registered the unit online and posted two messages to the apex support person ( there can ' t possibly be more than one !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .***T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .***O O O O T-POS O O O O T-POS O
a similarily priced 15 gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , it did motivate me to find a work - around solution .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality , or at least works .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t - mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t - mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the menu options are uncreative , as you can ' t see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .***O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .***O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one ASPECT#1 . even though they were not damaged in any way .***O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i accually did n't buy the apex ad-2600 from amazon but , the reviews i found here helped me purchase it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ripping & ASPECT#2ring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) .***T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .***O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .***O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .***T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .***O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can also search for your song , which is good .***O O O O O O O O O O O O

you can also create your own if you do n't like their classifications .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
only one disk played through to completion successfully .***O O T-NEG O O O O O O
but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .***O O O O O O O O O O
it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed - light settings .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .***T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300 - 500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you need your computer , however , if you want to add tracks to a playlist .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones !***O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O T-NEG O O O O O O
the zen has no stop button .***O O O O O O O
the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .***O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the way to fix this is to rename the track by adding a number yourself to the end of the track listing .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

very intuitive ASPECT#1s are a big plus on this camera .***O O O O O O O O O O O

before you try to return the player or waste hours calling apex tech support , or run the player over with your car , try these simple troubleshooting ideas first .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one minor complaint :***O O O O
100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software is great .***O T-POS O O O
compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc .***O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS O O O O O O O O
if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .***O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall i like the unit .***O O O O T-POS O
it also costs a lot less than the ipod .***O O O O O O O O O O

playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .***T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O

final verdict :***O O O
in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O T-POS O
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
everyone complains about the non - replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's easy for beginners to use , but has ASPECT#2s that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .***O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O

there are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet , so you have to live with it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did that and re - installed the software but had the same error .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
almost half what an ipod would cost you !***O O O O O O O O O
i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was always after it finished a process or something , so it did n't cause any file errors .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
some may complain that there 's no drag - and - drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for an early christmas gift , i got a zen xtra 40 gb player .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
print those coupons twice for two phones ?***O O O O O O O O
duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .***O O O O O O O O
you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i guess you get what you pay for .***O O O O O O O O O
and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .***O O T-NEG O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .***O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend buying one .***O O O O O O
i can ' t comment on the quality of the audio , because it was back at the store before i ripped a single cd .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the software you get with this camera is perfect .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O
simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .***O T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS T-POS O T-POS O O O O T-POS O T-POS O T-POS O
that 's probably a bad thing .***O O O O O O O
it takes great ASPECT#1s .***O O O O O
player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .***T-POS T-POS O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
the other company is currently " out of stock " so i ordered another from amazon and will be taking the original back to the competitor today .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i - pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought the 2600 because it plays everything !***O O O O O O O O O
we did n't get to use it again for over a month ( sad , i know ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mediasource itself was flaky ... crashing my explorer twice within the first hour ( the crash did n't require a reboot ) ... but after another reboot , it has n't crashed since .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
" i ' m not sure " . ) .***O O O O O O O O O O
the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc .***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O T-NEG T-NEG O
one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
another stupid move .***O O O O
first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ;***O O O O O O O O O O
of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times ASPECT#3s gets you just that much closer .***O O T-POS O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i then installed the software manually instead , after having to click past about 5 windows of " please register with us so we can spam your inbox " .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .***O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
i liked this one enough to buy another .***O O O O O O O O O
the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O
2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .***O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
good quality video .***O T-POS T-POS O
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .***O T-POS O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O
recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256 mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4 m pixel / fine combos and many of the user - friendly ASPECT#3s are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .***O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O
the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just get some new headphones and your set .***O O O O O O O O O
that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
please , if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions , i ' m wait very happy .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hope i ' ve been of some help .***O O O O O O O O O
while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great ASPECT#1s , ASPECT#2s and white balance .***O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far the dvd works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i ' ve read .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O
the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .***O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O T-POS O
this phone is very user - friendly , easy to manipulate & # 38 ; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O
the case had ad2600 .***O O O O O
i like the default blue .***O O O O O O
at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O O O
but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .***O O O O O O O O O O
another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .***O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery , so it 's good to go on a long vacation .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the g3 has most if not all of the ASPECT#1s that you would want from a semi - pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O
battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off - line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive***T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O T-NEG T-NEG O O

just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter i d tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc .***O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can ' t imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after receiving my zen xtra 40 gb mp3 player .. .***O O O O O O O O O O O
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough .***O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
the powershot g3 is a great camera .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O
- no propietary headset jack***O O O T-NEG T-NEG
you could have paid more and got a lot less .***O O O O O O O O O O O
the phone is very light weight .***O O O O O T-POS O
if you have a question , they have the answer .***O O O O O O O O O O O
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32 mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .***O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd ASPECT#1er play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O
the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .***O T-POS O O O T-POS T-POS O O O
it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .***T-POS O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
other things that i miss are voice - activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .***O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
anyone looking for more than " point and shoot " can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i did n't even try the included software .***O O O O O O O O O
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .***T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O
overall i ' m happy with my toy .***O O O O O O O O O
i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just make sure the keys are locked .***O O O O O O O O
my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .***O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll .***O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album , artist , song title , etc .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the ear - piece has a button that answers and hangs - up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording***O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O T-NEG O O T-NEG O T-NEG
an extra for a back - up battery would be a good investment .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have a 128 mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after investigating a multitude of player options , i asked for and received the 60 gb zen xtra for christmas .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's horrible .***O O O O
the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .***O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O
you can get weather , movies , horoscopes and more with a few clicks .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .***O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i do nt have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .***O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
the shutter lag is on par with what i ' ve experienced with point and shoot 35 mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128 mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

these are the reasons i think it 's great :***O O O O O O O O O O
i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do n't buy this player .***O O O O T-NEG O
the files are there , but i could not access the player without removing the battery , waiting a short period and re - inserting the battery .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you do n't have a gray card , you can use a plain white piece of paper .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
perhaps there is a way around this delay .***O O O O O O O O O
i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the ASPECT#1s are quite impressive .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !***O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .***O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'll admit that i 'd own an ipod if i had money to burn , but for the money this is a much better buy .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ended up sending the unit back to amazon .***O O O O O O O O O O

bought two ad2600 's for christmas .***O O O O O O O
this is a powerful piece of equipment .***O O O O O O O O
a great deal in general !***O O O O O O
30 gb is more than enough for most people .***O O O O O O O O O O
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .***O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon " , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O T-POS T-POS O
this problem vanished after the first month , so i assume it was a temporary dust issue .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .***O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .***O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
from what i ' ve heard it 's at least equal .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
it really does n't make any cents $ $ to build a great reputation then destroy it from lack a research and testing in one season .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter 's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nokia does not disappoint in this model .***O O O O O O O O
i ' ve been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .***O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which is nt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
on an average , you would charge it once a week .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's a dedicated music playing device , anyway , so this serves it better .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .***O T-POS O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
buy this camera and savour it .***O O O O O O O
go for it ...***O O O O
mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i agree with the positive reviews .***O O O O O O O
you should update the firmware before upgrading the drivers if you decide you need the newer drivers for the pc .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this thing because it plays everything .***O O O O O O O O O
all in all this a great player that blows the i - pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .***O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS T-POS O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
yes , the features are numerous .***O O O T-POS O O O
player has a problem with dual - layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .***O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O
you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the hands - free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .***O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sure enough there is no such ability .***O O O O O O O O
i love this player .***O O O T-POS O
who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie " extras " on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that .***O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O T-NEG O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the dvd player just would't recognize them .***O T-NEG T-NEG O O T-NEG O O
for those of you who has problems with this player , i 'd suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture , etc .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as i travelled internationally and did n't want to haul it back on a plane with me it was an expensive addition to the recycling bin .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well , it was nice while it lasted .***O O O O O O O O O
so go and buy dis sucka beefo it all be gone an stuffff .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sure , this thing is definitely more cost - effective than an ipod .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are not a lot of good options out there .***O O O O O O O O O O O
the controls definately took some getting used to .***O O O O O O O O O
they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts ? and labor !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
was i just unlucky at that moment ?***O O O O O O O O
the t610 has the most functionality hands down .***O O O O O O O O O
i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the bottom line :***O O O O
overall , a good buy for the price .***O O O O O O O T-POS O
for the price and features it is really good .***O O T-POS O T-POS O O O O O
negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .***O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !***O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in manual , you can set it to " single af " where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the lcd screen was very large and readable .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general - to moderate snapping .***O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .***O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .***O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O
i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the g2 was better in this respect .***O O O O O O O O
dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
for other problems go to http://www.apexdigitalinc.com/support.asp***O O O O O O
they piggy - back on cingular 's service .***O O O O O O O O O
it seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if only it played stand alone avi files .***O O O O O O O O O
wo n't play a lot of discs .***O O T-NEG O O O T-NEG O
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .***O O O O O T-POS O O O O O
poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i got one of these to serve as a second dvd player in my house .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .***O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it did have scored over all other competitors ....***O O O O O O O O O
the nomad is sent back to creative labs .***O O O O O O O O O
i was so excited about the price and reviews of this dvd player .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
made the camera totally inoperable .***O O T-NEG O O O
t - mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .***T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O
whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O
usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .***T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O
for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button , a ring around the enter / play button .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
many reviewers say the faceplate simply did n't fit well so they returned the zen .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they sell an adapter unit to use with your car 's cassette deck .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i used it lightly , and it lasted just over one year ( forgot to kill the power one day , and now it only plays dvds ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
all in all though i ' m very happy with my new mp3 player .***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
it focuses in a snap .***O O O O O O
do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .***O O O O O O O O O O O
updating the unit 's firmware :***O O O O O O
the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .***O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
this seemed like a really good compromise .***O O O O O O O O
i ' m very glad i did .***O O O O O O O O
not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .***O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .***O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O
i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone .***O O O O O O T-POS O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .***O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so , if you read the instructions well , you should n't have any problems with this dvd unit .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .***O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS O
this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i just used the explorer program to move my songs to my player .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while it is true that it will stand on end , it is also easy to knock over that way .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no comments on reliability , warranty , repairs , accessories .***O O O O O O O O O O O
1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal - to - noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head - phones as well as external speakers .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love the eos based ASPECT#1s and easy ASPECT#2s .***O O O O O O O O O O
hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3 - 5 gb of memory ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc . , used for digital media today has some kind of preloaded operating software on it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed .***O O O O O O O O O O O
i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes !***O O O O O O O T-NEG O
this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .***O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
once i actually got to an answering machine and left a message .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall design :***O O O
it is made of plastic .***O O T-NEG O O O
do n't drop this unit :***O O O O O O
so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button & you 're golden .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !***O O O O O O T-POS O O T-POS O O O
some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .***O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O T-POS O O O O O T-NEG O O
i ' m very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .***O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O
i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O
this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O
i have my mp3 's stored on my workstation .***O O O O O O O O O O

extremely convenient .***O O O
i ' ve have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so what ?***O O O
- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything .***O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'll just say this .. .***O O O O O O O
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .***O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .***O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
it has nt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i ' m at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .***O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O
i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O
this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .***O T-POS O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more ASPECT#1s .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .***O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O
8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ) .***O O O T-POS O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O
in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .***O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .***O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
whatever you do , do n't buy this product .***O O O O O O O O O O
excellent phone , the phone ASPECT#2s much better than what u see in the pictures .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this camera has a major design flaw .***O O O O O T-NEG O O
i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .***O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O
great phone .. .***O T-POS O O
i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean ASPECT#3s .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O
like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t - mobiles upgrade program .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
like the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
i am returning it , and again in the market for a multiformat dvd , svcd , vcd , mp3 , etc . player .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
bait and switch .***O O O O
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .***O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
the volume level of the phone is not all that good .***O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never use all the " whistles and bells " this machine is capable of .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well that s about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil have nt happened to me , and i hope it does nt .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .***O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this only to have it break within a month .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
plugged it in .***O O O O
quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .***O O O O T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
construction quality is a difficult item .***O O O O O O O
if not i will avoid apex products in the future .***O O O O O O O O O O O
( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if t - mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* removable battery***O O T-POS
i took the camera and just gave it to someone .***O O O O O O O O O O O
i also got a ur - e 4 step down ring adapter , lc - e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28 mm filter set .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
