however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .***O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research .***O O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased this unit 3 months back and i think the unit knew when my warrenty expires .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it gives great ASPECT#1s , the ASPECT#2s are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user - friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .***O O T-NEG O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the karma does have a stop button .***O O O O O O O O
in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .***O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .***O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it !***O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O
it is not perfect though .***O O O O O O
it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one of the calls was on a saturday and when i pressed the guy a bit , he said , " actually we do n't ship on saturdays " .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is by no means unique to this model , i ' m sure .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s , and it 's a lot nicer to access them 4.5 gb at a time ( dvd - r ) than 0.7 gb at a time ( cd - r ) !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job .***O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time ..***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .***O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O
sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve got 1200 songs on it now and about 4000 more to go .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
whereas some folks have the " ipod " , i have the " nomad jukebox zen xtra " ( not to be confused with the " nomad jukebox zen nx " ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 it is very compact but the ASPECT#1s are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .***T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O
3 . the ASPECT#1s come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( that s number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
simple to use and hook up .***O O O O O O O
the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .***O O O O T-NEG O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you can not make changes on the ipod that are premanent .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd - rom player .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^***O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
unfortunately , this digital moment - capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .***O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it worked from 12 - 26 to 1 - 9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews - my unit was n't the only one this happened to . )***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i checked out the amazon reviews and i ' m pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hope to get my refund in a timely manner .***O O O O O O O O O O
i got every song i had downloaded to the player within a day or so .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .***O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .***O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O
since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .***O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't want to install software and drivers on every computer i ' m ever at .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they take excellent macro shots as well .***O O O T-POS T-POS O O O
after nearly 800 ASPECT#1s i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and " explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player " to replace the mediasource .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the pc quickly picked up on it and attempted to install the software , which failed , as creative chose not to follow microsoft standards , whatever .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on - screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .***O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think for about $ 40 more , you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i find this to be a great feature .***O O O O O O O O O
for ipod you have to buy a cable and it is n't compatible with all windows pcs .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now , i thought it 's time to upgrade .***O O O O O O O O O O

first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i upgraded to a 6610 at my local t - mobile store .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have had great experience with amazon , but i will probably not buy electronics any more from them to avoid any future return problems .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the olympus is a bit clumsy - looking and the user - interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

hopefully you still have the remote control .***O O O O O O O O

well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .***T-POS O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
what makes the focus - lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O

within 5 minutes i was able to transfer files .***O O O O O O O O O O
in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so - so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc . ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i ' m just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .***O O O O O T-NEG O T-NEG O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i have had this player for 2 weeks , i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .***T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O

i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .***O O O T-POS O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files ( through mediasource ) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !***O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O

i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .***O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built - in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red - eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add - on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost - natural lighting .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40 gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can ' t create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .***O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i will just say this :***O O O O O O
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .***O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O
the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

every t - mobile plan comes with gsm data , meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps ( with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can ' t play everything .***O O O O T-NEG O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

there is usb , though .***O O O O O O
my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .***O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O O O O
in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the ASPECT#2s are very easy to use and produce good results .***O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O
but for now this will do .***O O O O O O O
after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc . creative 's online support was no help at all .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O

i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .***O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .***O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i ' ve seen .***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .***O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it also covers over the power jack when closed .***O O O O O O O O O O
and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now i do nt have to lug around 80 cds if i do nt know what i ' m going to want to listen to biking home .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i just put it on " shuffle " , sit back , and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure , the " duplicate name " problem stems from the actual file name , not from the song 's title / artist / album .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
just bought one & i ' ve enjoyed it to date .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember :***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one disk , it will not copy both -- it gives you the option of skipping the second or overwriting the first with the second .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid .***O O O O O O O O O O O O

i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O
while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps .***O O O O O O O O
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
battery life is good for a phone of this size .***T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O

the i / p button switches the tv display between interlace and progressive .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

one major complaint :***O O O O
1 . creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?***O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O T-POS O T-POS O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but i did n't because i ' m used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .***T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen .***O O T-NEG O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .***O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is extemely lame .***O O O O O
usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i just bought this player today and i already love it .***O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O
so , without further adoo .***O O O O O O
the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28 mm filters are expensive and hard to find .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O
and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it happened to me once .***O O O O O O
anyway , the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now i may buy two !***O O O O O O
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
strengths are well listed by other reviewers .***O O O O O O O O
the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well .***O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .***O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .***O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .***O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O

redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the most part this is a good dvd player .***O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
able to use service in another country :***O O O O O O O O
after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only ASPECT#2ed less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
- no option for caller - id pictures or individualized ringtones .***O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O T-NEG T-NEG O
i purchased this player last week .***O O O O O O O
finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on - line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy .***O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O
the ASPECT#1s are brilliant and the ASPECT#2s are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
about 10 % of the time it can ' t find the device when i attach it to my pc .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
had to cut out a window using a swiss army knife .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
so far , however , i ' m a very happy customer .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial . its very small and hard to turn so you can ' t get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
somewhat disappointed that i could not " hook up " to my sony multi brand remote commander .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of " juice " .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
unfortunatly it was dropped and damaged a year after i bought it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now i have to return it and rip all my music again .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i think it fell right on the earphone plug when it fell ( murphy strikes again ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will never buy a creative product again .***O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O
stayed up all night trying to figure out that thing .***O O O O O O O O O O O
connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no picture .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
think you need to pay a fortune for a good qulaity dvd player ?***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i just want to at least try an exchange but you can ' t get through to their number , it 's always busy .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .***O O O T-POS O O O O T-POS O O O O
bummer as it has great sound quality .***O O O O O O O O
try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i ' m sure i soon will .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O

a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O
the battery life on this phone is surreal .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
had i not been in such a hurry to load cds , i would have spotted them sooner .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies .***O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .***O O O T-NEG O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O
( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
lot 's of other features that i need to find out about .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great job canon !***O O O O
if you want a sexy , cool , accessory - availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? )***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
is this possible to fix , if so how , if not does notmad explorer from red chair software do this ?***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .***O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O
so far , we ' ve only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine .***O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
i was a little disappointed in the low end .***O O O O O O O O O O
it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ipod clearly has the most buzz .***O O O O O O O
3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web - site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .***O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .***T-POS O O O O O O O
my case does nt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case is nt that great .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .***O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my only significant complaint is sound quality .***O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so why lie about it ?***O O O O O O
it seems to be working fine , but we ' ve not used it all that much .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i recently bought this after my archos 20 multimedia self - destructed ( do n't get me started on that piece of junk ! ) and expected it to be flawless .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
overall , i ' m giving this 5 stars as i ' ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i ' ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i ' ve had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can ' t use nomad until you get home .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
those ASPECT#1d to 35 mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
again , you can change this , but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for example , jimi hendrix 's 2 cd live at the fillmore east had one cd classifed as classic rock and the other psychidelic rock .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent ASPECT#2s that way if you wanted to .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' m convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you ' ve downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
only if we could get one camera in it . .***O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
you can find any song quicky by an artist , album , or genre search .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have used this phone for two months now .***O O O O O O O O O O
so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .***O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all , access speed .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

do nt let the bad reviews of the software change your mind .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends , i bought this nokia 6610 .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
now i can transport files to friends house with ease .***O O O O O O O O O O O
excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game ASPECT#1s must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O
you will be sorry if you do .***O O O O O O O O
before i decided to get this player , i did my research .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6 - 8 hrs ( reviewers figures )***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .***T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is one of the nicest ASPECT#1s nokia has made .***O O O O O O O O O O O
i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
well worth the money .***O O O O O
but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .***O O O O O O O O
i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O T-POS O O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS O O T-POS O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O

on the up - side , the phone has amazing battery life .***O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O

i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non - work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .***T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
there was neither picture nor sound .***O O O T-NEG O T-NEG O
one thing puzzles me is that for " fine and 2200 + " quality pictures , one ultra 256 mb cf card can only hold 130 - 140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ASPECT#1ing - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O

i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .***O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O

second , the " automatic " sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of ASPECT#2s .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O
as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !***O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O

the dvd player is fine .***O T-POS T-POS O O O
lastly , the price is fantastic :***O O O T-POS O O O
go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O

only problem , if you think it 's going to be delivered in the 24hrs amazon claims , do n't hold your breath .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

a 35 mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O T-POS T-POS O
there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the " now playing " screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you tossed it out the window , you need to fetch it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
pay a few more bucks and get something else - it 'll be worth it in the long run .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' m sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
do not buy this player .***O O O O O O
apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have not spent much time with the included software , so i do n't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .***O T-POS O O O O O T-NEG O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

you see , i can ' t rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the reason for this the ipod has " a better user interface " .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media .***O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i ' ve bought the very expensive sanyo 5500 / vm4500 -- which i love -- and i ' m okay with my services .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the auto - mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile ASPECT#2s as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual .***O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ASPECT#1s kind of stink and you ca nt download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .***O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O
battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .***T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .***O T-POS O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O
the ASPECT#1s on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1 . for some sizing information ) .***O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

i am really impressed by this dvd player .***O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O

huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

ipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it " unnecessary " and " so 20th century " .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i am not talking milliseconds .***O O O O O O
the cd will be classified into a number of genres , and in multidisk sets , you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

this is one of those items that , at first glance , looked cool but did n't really ring a bell with me .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear - peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high - speed internet connection .***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

as soon as i lifted the unit out of the box , i questioned my judgement .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

5 . the zen does not have a stop button !***O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O

i am a long - time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

my choices at that moment were to manually re - tag my music or re - rip using mediasource .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .***O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
while you can create a temporary playlist , you can ' t store it permanently , delete songs , search very easily , etc .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the moveable lcd screen is great .***O O T-POS O O O O

i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve tried several dvd 's and even new ones do the same thing .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .***O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
i personally do n't like apple or their business practices ( screwing resellers , customers and employees left and right ) so i shopped around for something else .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' m sending this pup back to amazon and looking for the 2500 on ebay .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
is my unit defective ?***O O O O O
and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars , i 'll end up spending more than twice that .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
much cheaper than i - pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back - lit screen ) if you ' ve read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate***O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .***O O O O O O T-POS O O O
i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled " on " button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :***O O O O O O O O O O
i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc - p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural - light portraits i never would have attempted before .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
through the software you can classify songs in genres .***O O O O O O O O O O
it did play a dvd - r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .***O O T-POS O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O
besides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for the price and size and features , you can ' t beat the price .***O O T-POS O T-POS O T-POS O O O O O O O O O
it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .***O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
now i know better .***O O O O O
2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point - and - shoot lens )***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack .***O O O O O O O O O O O
some of the more geeky ( non - apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple - like interface .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
hopefully you wo n't regret .***O O O O O O
because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non - regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non - american region dvd 's .***O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
yes it is 56k speed , but the functionality is what you are paying for .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

of course you do !***O O O O O
i have owned an apex ad-3201 for close to 3 years now and i love that deck .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you are better off deleting it , re - ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop - off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .***O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the most important thing for me is sound quality .***O O O O O O O O O O

if that is for you then pay the money , learn from the experience and you 'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device # 2 .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large - ASPECT#3 player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O T-POS O O O T-POS O O O O O

2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i ' m even using a speakerphone .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

do not underestimate this in your purchase decision .***O O O O O O O O O
i can ' t write enough positive things about this great little camera !***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
no big deal for the size . .***O O O O O O O O
it was no problem for me to use their software .***O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve bought 3 apex dvd players now .***O O O O O O O O O O
ok , that happens , so i try to skip the chapter .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
save your cash - go for a brand that actually cares about their reputation .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .***O O O O T-POS O O O O O
headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .***T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .***O T-POS T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O
none of these are perfect .***O O O O O O
for ` ` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
other than that this thing is great ...***O O O O T-POS O O O
because once the moment is gone , it is not coming back .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
first let me give you the bad things :***O O O O O O O O O
third , the poor design continues with the case .***O O O O T-NEG O O O T-NEG O
the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .***O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 ) a spare battery would have been great .***O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O
i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .***O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O
the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
this phone is a winner ...***O T-POS O O O O
i paid twenty dollars more than the current price , and even then it was a steal .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .***O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS O O T-POS O
and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .***O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O
the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
consider it for a future gift too !***O O O O O O O O
bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri - band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this is ridiculous .***O O O O
my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i can ' t rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .***O T-NEG O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
each of the 4 lasted less than six months .***O O O O O O O O O O
i found the ASPECT#1s very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .***O O T-POS O O O O T-POS O O O O O
sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 .***O O O O O O O O O O
i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i will not be ordering another one to replace it .***O O O O O O O O O O O
easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot .***O O T-POS O O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS O O O O
more downside to this phone ?***O O O O O O
the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can ' t say much about the motorolla .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
picture on web site clearly has the play display pictured , yet false silver plate .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .. .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the only drawbacks that i have noticed :***O O O O O O O O
a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately would nt survive a drop***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the player itself has all sorts of problems .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O
press the p / n button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .***O T-POS O O O T-POS O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG O
this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit***O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O
excellent idea !***O O O
after " loading " for what seemed like a very long time , the display indicated " no disk " .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
also love waking up to music with attached speakers .***O O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O
this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can ' t , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the player controls are too easy to hit accidentally .***O O O O O O O O O O
making the step from film to digital has been a great move .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O
while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O O T-POS T-POS O T-POS O
it was worth a shot -- too bad it did n't work out .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , ASPECT#1s produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would ' ve still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .***O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O O O T-NEG O O O O O
the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you do nt like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .***O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O
i would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre - production and production model reviews were positive .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ordered two of these puppies for christmas gifts .***O O O O O O O O O O
also , the instruction manual is very bad .***O O O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O
i ' m starting to listen to cd 's that i have n't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
so now i ' ve got to call their customer " service " ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
i ' ve had no problem with canon whatsoever .***O O O O O O O O O O
the trouble shooting section in the user 's manual , suggesting correct and secure connections , does n't help .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
amazon.com promptly refunded my money for the first one , because a replacement was not available ( thanks amazon.com !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i - pod . )***O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
did buy a 256 mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i spoke to a rep . at apex and was told that a new format is being used and we wo nt be able to view any disney movies made in the last couple months .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
that 's a rare and valuable feature .***O O O O O O T-POS O
granted this is cheaper than an ipod .***O O O O O O O O
otherwise , you 'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the ( decent ) nomad explorer , which is not fun at all .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .***O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper - du - jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
interface - practically seamless .***T-POS O O O O
there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !***O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
it ships with a carrying case that has a belt clip on it .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is amazing that the battery ASPECT#2s so long when the phone is so small and light .***O O O O O T-POS O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O
yup , right back for a refund !***O O O O O O O O
i have had it lock up after a transfer of music .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
that s it .***O O O O
2 ) buy a good pair of head - phones unless you already own one .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .***O T-POS O O O O T-POS O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of " plastic - like " ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !***O T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
nothing but hassle with this company .***O O O O O O O
i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .***O O O O T-POS T-POS O
i bought this dvd player in november .***O O O O O O O O
i would not give up this phone for the world .***O O O O O O O O O O O
mixed bag i guess but the price was right .***O O O O O O T-POS O O O
wish it included somebody to re - rip all the songs .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
now that i own it , however , i can ' t imagine being without it !***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
another plus in my book , no file limits !***O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .***O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O
and really this is the best phone one could have .***O O O O O O T-POS O O O O
most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full - featured viable alternatives exist .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .***O O O O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-POS O
it has 2 games .***O O O O O
the product manufacturer promised me 14 hours , and what i recieved was 6 - 8 .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but , i would definately recommend this phone .***O O O O O O O T-POS O
other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .***O O O O T-POS O O O T-POS O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the camera comes with a lexar 16 mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
oh well ..***O O O
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .***O O T-POS O O O O O O O
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t - mobile .***O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG T-NEG T-NEG O
although the sound - quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable - mp 3 player to result in a good product .***O O T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O O O O
it was marked up increadably high compared to other models ( almost $ 500 for a 30 gb ) , and there s was nothing about it that made it worth that much money .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
but at least you re starting with the most photorealistic ASPECT#1s i ve ever seen from a camera .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .***O T-NEG T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone " unlike the nokia 3650 " and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ...***O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O
8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white - correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper ASPECT#1s .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower - priced progressive scan players as well ) .***T-POS T-POS T-POS O O O O T-POS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it suppose to play everything .***O O O O O O
software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .***T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .***T-POS O O O O O O O O O O T-POS T-POS O O T-POS O
the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful .***O O T-NEG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to , instead of just connecting it with a usb connection .***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
the quality is superb .***O T-POS O O O
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?***O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O T-NEG O O O O
overall an excellent phone .***O O O T-POS O
lastly , you can not manage anything on the ipod itself .***O O O O O O O O O O O O
